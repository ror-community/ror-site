See ROR IDs in the wild! A number of systems have already integrated or are working on integrating with ROR to collect and display clean and consistent affiliation data.

ROR has open data and infrastructure to facilitate integrations. For integration support, join the [ROR Tech Support Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-tech) and check out the [developer documentation](https://ror.readme.io/).
