ROR is the Research Organization Registry, a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world.

The scholarly community depends on a network of open identifier and metadata infrastructure. Content identifiers and contributor identifiers are foundational components of this network. But an additional component has been missing---until now, there has been no open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata. With the aim of filling this gap, the ROR MVR (minimum viable registry) launched in January 2019 and began assigning unique ROR IDs to more than 91,000 organizations. Read more about the [scope of the ROR MVR and product roadmap](https://ror.org/scope).

ROR is intended for use by the research community, for the purposes of increasing the use of organization identifiers in the community and enabling connections between organization records in various systems. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata will enable more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.

ROR is run by a small group of steering organizations in collaboration with a broad network of community advisors. Read more about the [ROR Community](https://ror.org/community).

## History
ROR is the culmination of several years of extensive community collaboration to develop a shared vision for a registry of organization identifiers.

Between 2016 and 2018, a group of 17 organizations with a shared purpose invested their time and energy into an Org ID initiative with the goal of defining requirements for an open, community-led organization identifier registry that would benefit all of our communities. A number of activities took place as part of this initiative. Here is a brief timeline:

-   A series of collaborative workshops took place at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) meeting in San Antonio TX (2016), the FORCE11 conference in Portland OR (2016), and at PIDapalooza in Reykjavik (2016).
-   Findings from these workshops were summarized in three documents, which were made openly available to the community for public comment:
-   Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/2906))
-   Organization Identifier Provider Landscape ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/4716))
-   Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/7885))
-   A [Working Group](https://orcid.org/content/organization-identifier-working-group) worked throughout 2017 and voted to approve a core set of recommendations and principles for the registry and its governance, drawing from conversations with community stakeholders:
-   [Governance Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Governance_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402002/1)
-   [Product Principles and Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Product_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402047/1)
-   A [Request for Information](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5458162.v1) sought expressions of interest from organizations to be involved in implementing and running an organization identifier registry.
-   Following an enthusiastic response to the RFI, there was a [stakeholder meeting in Girona](https://orcid.org/content/2018-org-id-meeting) in January 2018 at which ORCID, DataCite, and Crossref were tasked with drafting a proposal that met the Working Group's requirements.

In the discussions and planning process that followed the Girona meeting, it became clear that building a pilot registry would be a practical place to start, with governance and other community layers ultimately built around it. A new steering group consisting of California Digital Library, Crossref, DataCite, and Digital Science stepped up to implement the pilot, with a donation of seed data from Digital Science's GRID database. The pilot was called the Research Organization Registry and thus ROR was born! &rarr;
