The scholarly research community depends on a series of open identifier and metadata infrastructure systems to great success. Content identifiers and contributor identifiers are foundational infrastructure for the community. But there is one piece of the infrastructure that is missing – there currently is no open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata.

Therefore, after extensive community consultation, ROR was launched. ROR will be providing organization identifiers that are globally unique, stable, discoverable, and resolvable. In addition, ROR will develop appropriate metadata schema for organizations and explore interoperability with other identifiers through relationship metadata. Community is what drives ROR, so please consider getting involved.

## History

Between 2016 and 2018, a group of 17 organizations with a shared purpose invested their time and energy into an Org ID initiative, with the goal of defining requirements for an open, community-led organization identifier registry. The initiative was a transparent, accessible process to help work towards a better system for all of our communities.

The activities that have lead to ROR are numerous:

-   A series of collaborative workshops were held at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) meeting in San Antonio TX (2016), the FORCE11 conference in Portland OR (2016), and at PIDapalooza in Reykjavik (2016).
-   Findings from these workshops were summarized in three documents, which we made openly available to the community for public comment:
  -   Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/2906))
  -   Organization Identifier Provider Landscape ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/4716))
  -   Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/7885))
-   A [Working Group](https://orcid.org/content/organization-identifier-working-group) worked throughout 2017 and voted to approve a set of recommendations and principles for 'governance' and 'product':
  -   [Governance Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Governance_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402002/1)
  -   [Product Principles and Recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Product_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402047/1)
-   We then put out a [Request for Information](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5458162.v1) that sought expressions of interest from organizations to be involved in implementing and running an organization identifier registry.
-   There was a really good response to the RFI; reviewing the responses and thinking about next steps led to our most recent [stakeholder meeting in Girona](https://orcid.org/content/2018-org-id-meeting) in January 2018, where ORCID, DataCite, and Crossref were tasked with drafting a proposal that meets the Working Group's requirements for a community-led, organizational identifier registry.
