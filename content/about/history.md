## Pre-history of ROR

Between 2016 and 2018, a group of 17 organizations with a shared purpose invested their time and energy into what was then known as the "Org ID" initiative, with the goal of defining requirements for an open, community-led organization identifier registry that would benefit all of our communities.

### 2016

In 2016, a series of collaborative workshops took place at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) meeting in San Antonio, Texas, the FORCE11 conference in Portland, Oregon, and at PIDapalooza in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Findings from these workshops were summarized in three documents, which were made openly available to the community for public comment:
- [Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward](https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20161031-OrgIDGovernance.pdf)
- [Organization Identifier Provider Landscape](https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20161031-OrgIDProviderSurvey.pdf)
- [Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry](https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20161031-Functional-Reqts-OrgIDs.pdf).

### 2017

A [Working Group](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.12827315) worked throughout 2017 and voted to approve a core set of [governance recommendations](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5402002) and [product principles](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5402047), drawing from conversations with community stakeholders.

A [Request for Information](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5458162) sought expressions of interest from organizations to be involved in implementing and running an organization identifier registry.

### 2018

Following an enthusiastic response to the RFI, there was a stakeholder meeting in Girona, Spain, in January 2018, at which ORCID, DataCite, and Crossref were tasked with drafting a proposal that met the Working Group's requirements.

In the discussions and planning process that followed the Girona meeting, it became clear that building a pilot registry would be a practical place to start, with governance and other community layers ultimately built around it.

A [new steering group consisting of California Digital Library, Crossref, DataCite, and Digital Science](https://ror.org/blog/2018-12-02-the-ror-of-the-crowd/) stepped up to implement the pilot, with a donation of seed data from Digital Science's GRID database. The pilot was called the Research Organization Registry, and thus ROR was born! 

## Launch of ROR 

The first iteration of the registry, known as the Minimum Viable Registry (MVR) was [launched in January 2019](https://ror.org/blog/2019-02-10-announcing-first-ror-prototype/) at an open community meeting at PIDapalooza in Dublin, Ireland.

The MVR and first registry release included ROR IDs and metadata for 91,625 organizations and was built from seed data from GRID. The MVR also included mechanisms for accessing and querying ROR data via a search interface, REST API, and data dump. 

## Startup phase 

### 2019

ROR's early years following its launch in early 2019 were focused on developing the registry's infrastructure beyond the MVR, raising community awareness and encouraging adoption, establishing a governance structure, and building a foundation for long-term sustainability.

- ROR's Community Advisory Group was established in March 2019 and began to meet in bimonthly online Community Calls.

- [Dryad became the first ROR adopter](/blog/2019-07-10-ror-ing-together-with-dryad/) in July 2019.
