ROR respects the privacy of our users and we comply with applicable laws to safeguard users' information. We follow a few basic principles related to privacy:

We don't ask for personal information unless we truly need it.

We don't share personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for on-going business operations.

If you find content on the ROR website, Github site, blog, or social media channels that you believe violates our Privacy Policy, please contact <info@ror.org> immediately.

## Website, Github, Blog, and Services

ROR operates a website at <https://ror.org>, maintains code on a Github site at <https://www.github.com/ror-community>, maintains documentation on a Readme.io site at <https://ror.readme.io>, publishes blog posts at <https://ror.org/blog>, and manages support requests via email at <info@ror.org>. It is ROR's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating these sites and services. If you have questions about deleting or correcting any personal data you find on these sites please contact <info@ror.org>.

## Site Visitors

Like most site operators, ROR collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ROR users interact with its sites.

## General Treatment of Personally-Identifying Information

Visitors to ROR's sites can choose to interact with ROR in ways that require ROR to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ROR gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

For example, visitors who contact ROR by email are required to provide an email address. ROR does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in the Protection of Information section below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities or receiving customized support.

## ROR Community Communications

ROR does not employ a formal membership model but ROR does engage in discussions and projects with members of the community who are interested in being involved with the project. Depending on the type of activity or desired type of involvement, community members who have expressed an interest in ROR may receive notifications about upcoming webinars or calls, product updates, project developments, or other news that impact ROR sites and services. These communications take place via MailChimp mail services and via email associated with the ror.org domain hosted by Gmail. We store individuals' names and contact information in MailChimp and in the Gmail account. Individuals may remove themselves from these communications by following the unsubscribe link in general mailings or by sending a request to <info@ror.org> to be removed from general mailing lists and direct message threads.

## Documentation

ROR provides documentation and support guidance on a Readme.io site (<https://ror.readme.io>) to help enable ROR users to interact with ROR data and services. Readme.io fully [complies](https://readme.io/gdpr/) with current privacy regulations.

## Metadata and Identifiers

ROR provides a registry of unique identifiers for research organizations and associated metadata about these organizations. All of the metadata and Identifiers registered with ROR are made available for use and reuse without restriction and under a CC0 license through our public APIs, search interfaces, and dataset downloads from Figshare and Zenodo. We are open and transparent about the use of our identifiers and metadata.

## ROR Support Queries

Help and support queries are handled via email to <info@ror.org>. Any details provided during a support conversation are kept private. From time to time ROR may add your email to an appropriate mailing list for additional information. Individuals may remove themselves from mailings by following the unsubscribe link provided in messages or by contacting <info@ror.org>.  

## Comments on the ROR Blog

Readers of the [ROR blog](https://ror.org/blog) can submit comments on each post. ROR uses a platform called [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to enable comments on the blog. Users can control their privacy settings with a Disqus account.

## Email Communications

ROR uses email to communicate with ROR community members and users of our services. These communications are sent from ROR's Gmail account or via MailChimp. Individuals may remove themselves from mailings by following the unsubscribe link provided in MailChimp messages or by contacting <info@ror.org> to be removed from email communications. We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law.

## Aggregated Statistics

ROR may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, ROR may monitor the most popular pages, support articles, and blog posts on the sites. ROR may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ROR does not disclose personally-identifying information other than described in the Protection of Information section below.

## Protection of Information

ROR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its project team members and affiliated organizations that:

1.  need to know that information in order to process it on ROR's behalf or to provide services available at ROR's websites, and

2.  have agreed to comply with current privacy regulations.

ROR will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its project team members and affiliated organizations, as described above, ROR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a court order or other governmental request, or when ROR believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ROR, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a user of ROR services and have supplied your email address, and you would like to be removed, please send a request for removal to <info@ror.org>. ROR takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
