bio = "Liz [joined the ROR team in late 2020](https://blog.datacite.org/working-at-the-intersection-of-people-and-technology/) as our first Adoption Manager and developed extensive guidance to support ROR users and integrators before [stepping into the role of ROR Technical Lead in February 2022](/blog/2022-02-14-new-year-at-ror/#changes-on-the-ror-team), a role she held through April 2025. In both roles, Liz was based at [DataCite](https://datacite.org). Before joining DataCite, Liz was at ORCID for 6 years, where she held roles ranging from member support to technical lead. A librarian by training and a software developer by necessity, Liz thrives at the intersection of people, processes and technology. She loves understanding the human and technological aspects of systems and developing solutions that suit both the people and the machines."
