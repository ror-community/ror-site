Every year [since 2019](/blog/2019-02-10-announcing-first-ror-prototype), we've celebrated ROR's anniversary at the same time we hold our annual community meeting, updating everyone on what ROR has accomplished in the last year and expressing our gratitude for the help of the ROR community. This year, the 2024 annual meeting featured five online events: a [general update and fifth anniversary celebration](/events/2024-01-30-annual-meeting-and-fifth-anniversary), a [community showcase](/2024-01-30-community-showcase), a [panel on funding metadata](/events/2024-01-31-why-we-all-need-good-funding-metadata), and two informal (unrecorded) drop-in sessions. 

We had over 300 unique registrants for our three recorded sessions, making this the most popular ROR annual community meeting ever! It was a true delight to see so many ROR users and supporters come together and to meet some people who are new to ROR. If you missed the meeting, here are the highlights. 

### ROR Annual Meeting and Fifth Anniversary Celebration

The [2024 edition of the main ROR annual meeting](/events/2024-01-30-annual-meeting-and-fifth-anniversary) was a special one! We took the opportunity to reflect on the last five years, remembering where we started and how we got here. We heard about where we’ve been and where we’re going in terms of our community of adopters, our curation activities, and our tech. Most importantly, we acknowledged ROR community contributors, without whom we’d never have come this far, and we did some brainstorming about what’s next. 

#### Selected highlights

- A look back at an **early [white paper](https://doi.org/10.5438/7885)** and the working groups that resulted in ROR circa 2016-2019, plus other memories
- Stats of ROR adoption include a staggering **1.48 million DOIs registered with DataCite that include ROR IDs** to identify creators or contributors
- The number of requests to add new records to ROR has surged from 50 per month in January 2022 to **more than 700 per month** in January 2024
- Key technical accomplishments in 2023 include schema v2 development, implementation, and beta test; anticipated for 2024 is the **public launch of v2 and a redesigned affiliation matching service**
- The ROR Community agrees that key priorities for 2024 and the next five years include **increased publisher adoption** -- and ROR t-shirts!

### Community Showcase

The [Community Showcase](/events/2024-01-30-community-showcase) featured presentations on how ROR is used in some key global scholarly systems and workflows, including at [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org), [4Science / DSpace-CRIS](https://www.4science.com/dspace-cris/), [ORCID](https://orcid.org), [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/), US Department of Energy's [Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI)](https://osti.gov), and the ROR Implementation Task Group of the [NIH’s Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/generalist-repository-ecosystem-initiative). 

#### Selected highlights

- A **live demo** of OpenAlex's web interface, whose institutional data relies on ROR 
- ROR will be on the roadmap for **DSpace 8.0**
- ROR IDs now account for **half of new affiliations created in ORCID**; over 1.2 million ORCID records have a ROR ID and more than 50,000 unique ROR IDs are represented in ORCID
- **Springer Nature currently has over 1.1 million ROR IDs in its metadata** and its next steps are to add ROR IDs to already published content, provide ROR IDs to Crossref during metadata deposit, and evaluate other potential internal use cases for ROR
- **OSTI will begin including ROR IDs in its metadata** once they deploy their new internal authority as part of E-Link 2.0, their new research submission tool
- Of the 7 repository systems participating in NIH's GREI initiative, **5 have already adopted ROR for organizational affiliations and 3 have adopted ROR for funder associations**

### Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata

The session [Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata](/events/2024-01-31-why-we-all-need-good-funding-metadata) addressed the issue that funding information is an increasingly important piece of metadata for many stakeholders, yet standardizing and using identifiers for funders remains a challenge. With ROR [set to become the standard persistent identifier for funders](https://ror.org/blog/2023-09-07-open-funder-registry-transition-ror-cross-post/), we convened a panel for ROR’s annual community meeting to hear from diverse perspectives about how funding metadata is used and what might make it better. We heard from funders, publishers, metadata specialists, and more, including  [CHORUS](https://chorusagccess.org), the [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://rsc.org), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org), [Crossref](https://crossref.org), and [Stratos](https://strategiesos.org/) for [Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/).

#### Selected highlights
All panelists were asked "If you had a magic wand, what would be the one thing you'd do to improve funding metadata?" The answers: 

- "Make extracting PIDs and their associated metadata from articles, datasets and software **simple, open and affordable** for all!"
- "All organisations and systems **consistently using standard PIDs** for people, organisations, grants, projects, data and publications throughout the funding, research and publication processes"
- "Systems/tools can **accurately extract & identify funders from authors’ acknowledgements** and match to funder IDs at the point of submission"
- "All **funder data available through APIs**"

### Let's ROR some more in 2024!

ROR has come a long way in the last five years, and ROR is going even farther in the next five. Heartfelt gratitude is due to everyone in the community who has helped to make ROR a reality, including the [ROR Operations Team](/about/#operations-team); the [ROR Curation Advisors](/community/#curation-advisory-board); the [ROR Steering Group](/community/#steering-group); ROR [Sustaining Supporters](/community/#supporters); ROR [adopters and integrators](https://bit.ly/ror-integrations); members of the [ROR technical forum](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-tech) and [ROR Slack](https://tinyurl.com/ror-slack); subscribers to the ROR [quarterly newsletter](http://eepurl.com/gjkT9H); our colleagues at [Crossref](https://crossref.org), [DataCite](https://datacite.org), and the [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org); all the [alumni and affiliates](/about/#alumni-and-affiliates) who helped build ROR; everyone who presents at a ROR community call and participates in our [case studies](/categories/case-studies); all those who attend ROR [events](/events); and the many, many people who [ask for a change or addition to ROR records](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues). We wouldn’t be here without your engagement and support!

Hope to see you all throughout 2024 and at the next annual meeting in 2025.
