The American Physical Society (APS) has become the largest society publisher to adopt ROR, incorporating it into their manuscript submission process and sending ROR IDs in author affiliation metadata to Crossref. "We've been eagerly supporting ROR since before it was ROR," said APS Lead Data Analyst Arthur Smith. Read the whole announcement from APS below, then watch Arthur's marvelous presentation about the APS integration from last week's [ROR Community Call](/events/2024-07-16-ror-community-call).

## American Physical Society Becomes Largest Society Publisher to Adopt Research Organization Registry Identifiers

The [American Physical Society](https://www.aps.org/homepage-launch) has adopted the [Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org) identification system, assigning persistent identifiers to authors' affiliations for every paper published in the [Physical Review journals](http://journals.aps.org). The action comes as a response to challenges faced by the scientific community regarding metadata tracking.

Researchers, institutions, and libraries alike rely on high quality, accurate metadata to monitor publication output and impact. However, institutional metadata has lacked standardization across the publishing landscape. By assigning openly available ROR persistent identifiers, APS provides a solution to this problem and more. These identifiers will help authors and institutions keep track of the scope of their work.

APS also sends ROR identifiers to [Crossref](https://crossref.org), an online record for scholarly metadata. The initiative makes relevant metadata discoverable across all search tools, with implications for funding and for participating in open access models.

APS is one of the first publishers to incorporate ROR identifiers in published metadata, demonstrating the society’s commitment to advancing open science.

## Watch APS discuss their adoption of ROR 

Last week at the [ROR Community Call](/events/2024-07-16-ror-community-call), APS Lead Data Analyst Arthur Smith explained why and how APS adopted ROR IDs for author affiliation identification. 

{{<youtube id="qH1JXbAxbYU" title="Featured ROR integrator American Physical Society" class="blog-video" >}}

The American Physical Society may be the largest society publisher so far to adopt ROR, but we know they won't be the last. Kudos to APS for helping to lead the way.
