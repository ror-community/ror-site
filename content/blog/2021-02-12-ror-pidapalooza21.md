In the same week that [ROR celebrated its third birthday](/blog/2021-02-03-ror-annual-meeting), [PIDapalooza](https://pidapalooza.org) celebrated the fifth festival of persistent identifiers, also as a virtual event. Across three tracks, seven languages, and twenty-hour hours, PIDapalooza21 highlighted the latest updates from the wide world of persistent identifiers, with a focus how open infrastructure and rich metadata are key to harnessing the power of PIDs. As a prime example of open identifier infrastructure that is designed to enrich scholarly metadata, ROR featured prominently in many PIDapalooza21 sessions. Here are some highlights, with links to the recordings:

- A series of "PIDs for Beginners" sessions held in multiple languages included information about ROR in [Japanese](https://youtu.be/666QvvB6qJ0), [Chinese](https://youtu.be/c8b4aM_98cA), French, [Portuguese](https://youtu.be/JoFs5CZyYg8), [German](https://youtu.be/r25OYsl6WNE), and [English](https://youtu.be/jav---epwkQ).
- Hindawi intern Alessandra Audino's presentation, "[Connecting PIDs and Open Infrastructure to publisher workflows: Hindawi as a use case](https://youtu.be/6AwNY2VoK58)," outlines the many use cases for publishers to incorporate organization identifiers into their workflows and systems, using ROR as a model.
- In "[Extending ROR: Wag the Lion](https://youtu.be/R4KBcLhnyVA)," ROR community members Carolyn Grant, Quinn Hart, and Arthur Smith, shared their project to build an extension for ROR to identify departmental units within organizations
- Natasha Simons and Fiona Murphy discussed [RAiD](https://youtu.be/gI3B7GNyTXs), the initiative to develop an identifier and infrastructure for research project identifiers, and how RAiD can use ROR to identify institutions.
- In the session "[Positive people present their persistent pursuit of practically perfect priority PID partnerships](https://youtu.be/Vr8axfTCTDI)," Chris Brown and Josh Brown discussed efforts to develop a unified national approach to PIDs in the UK, including developing a list of priority PIDs for research infrastructure, including ROR.
- Last but not least, Juan Pablo Alperin's [plenary session](https://youtu.be/1C9Ainp1Hu8) took the form of an epic poem about PKP's approach to integrating PIDs, including ROR.

ROR also presented "The ABCs of ROR," a general orientation to the basics of ROR in PIDapalooza's PIDs 101 track geared at introducing newcomers to different identifiers. This session was run twice, once in [English](https://youtu.be/MruefxeOwR0) and once in [Spanish](https://youtu.be/GSoN5gvbawc).
