We are thrilled to introduce a new member of the ROR pride: Riley Marsh joined the ROR team in August as our new Metadata Manager.

As Metadata Manager, Riley will support the day-to-day activities of curating the ROR registry, including triaging incoming requests and processing changes for new registry releases. Riley will work closely with ROR’s Curation Advisory Board to maintain ROR’s metadata policies and practices as well as working to understand and support various community use cases that might influence ROR's curation processes and procedures. Based at [Crossref](https://crossref.org), which is one of ROR’s three operating organizations, Riley will also contribute to metadata schema development activities on the Crossref side. 

Riley brings a strong background to this work, most recently having worked at Tulane University Libraries in the Digital Scholarship & Initiatives department, supporting digital collections, electronic theses and dissertations, and various digitization projects across campus and beyond. 

Former Metadata Curation Lead Adam Buttrick continues to be involved in ROR in his [new role as persistent identifiers product manager at California Digital Library](https://ror.org/blog/2024-05-22-new-positions/).

With Riley joining the team, it is an opportunity to reflect on and emphasize the importance of the workflows, policies, infrastructure, and above all the people that ensure ROR's metadata is carefully curated and actively maintained so that our global user base has access to clean, comprehensive, and accurate records. 

As a reminder, anyone can suggest registry additions and updates via [this form](https://curation-request.ror.org). All suggestions are processed according to ROR’s curation policies, which are developed with our Curation Advisory Board, and tracked openly on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/ror-community/projects/19) so you can see what has been suggested and follow suggestions as they go through the process. Registry updates are published approximately once a month, and the latest data is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.6347574) and in the [ROR API](https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api). 

For more information about curation, read more on the [registry web page](https://ror.org/registry/) and in the [ror-updates GitHub repository](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates?tab=readme-ov-file#ror-updates).
