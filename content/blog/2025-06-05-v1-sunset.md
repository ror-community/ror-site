One of the highlights of 2024 for the ROR team and the ROR community was the [release of version 2 of the ROR API and schema](/blog/2024-04-15-announcing-ror-v2/). We spent many months [working together to develop a stable, feature-rich, future-proof](https://ror.readme.io/docs/feedback-docs) model for ROR v2 that offers key features such as creation and modification dates for ROR records, places to store language codes for all organization names, and easy-to-update external identifier elements.

**In 2025, therefore, we're planning to sunset version 1 of the ROR schema and API.** Last year we reminded the community periodically that version 2 is the recommended version of ROR, and we shared a rough timeline for the stages of v1 sunset [at our Annual Community Meeting in early February](/events/2025-02-04-annual-meeting-community-update/). Today, we're sharing further details and more precise dates for the deprecation of version 1 of ROR so that ROR users have all the lead time they need to make any necessary changes.

## Timeline for ROR v1 sunset

Here's our basic timeline for deprecating version 1 of ROR.

## What you can expect in July

In July, ROR API requests with no version in the path will default to v2 instead of v1. What does that mean, exactly? Here are three examples of the same request to the ROR API for a list of organizations whose type is "funder", one that specifies version 1, one that specifies version 2, and one that does not specify a version:

`https://api.ror.org/v1/organizations?filter=types:funder`

{{< figure src="/img/blog/v1-sunset/ror-api-v1-request.png" class="blog-figure" alt="ROR API v1 response." >}}

`https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations?filter=types:funder`

{{< figure src="/img/blog/v1-sunset/ror-api-v2-request.png" class="blog-figure" alt="ROR API v2 response." >}}

`https://api.ror.org/organizations?filter=types:funder`

{{< figure src="/img/blog/v1-sunset/ror-api-no-version-request.png" class="blog-figure" alt="ROR API v1 response." >}}

All three of these requests return the same number and set of records, but you'll notice that the request without a version in the path currently returns records that use [ROR schema version 1.0](https://ror.readme.io/v1/docs/data-structure). In July, that will change, and an API request that does not specify a version in the path will return records that use [ROR schema version 2.1](https://ror.readme.io/v2/docs/schema-2-1).



 ## What you can expect in December



## Additional comments / points

As of late 2024, most requests to the ROR API have no version in the path.

{{< figure src="/img/blog/v1-sunset/api-version-requests.png" class="blog-figure" alt="Stats for version requests to ROR API showing 4 million for v2, 135,000 for v1, and 8.93 million with no version specified." >}}

 - Take a look at our API and schema versioning policy
- ROR v2 was specifically designed to last for quite awhile

- If you've already switched from v1 to v2 we'd love to hear from you
- We're here to help
- Remember that ROR Client ID is also coming, which will help us better communicate changes like these to ROR users
