In December 2020, ROR released a [public self-assessment](https://ror.org/blog/2020-12-16-aligning-ror-with-posi/) of our alignment with the [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/) (POSI). 

At the time, the POSI framework, originally articulated in 2005, had been recently (re)codified as a set of concrete guidelines, inspiring a group of open scholarly infrastructure initiatives to assess how well they were aligned with these principles. 

For ROR, this context was particularly relevant as we were in the early stages of formalizing our operating model and exploring pathways to long-term sustainability. POSI was a helpful roadmap to inform our strategic decision-making and a useful framework for contextualizing and organizing our operations.

A revised version of the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure ([v2.0](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/POSI_compare_october2025_rationale_3.pdf)) was released in October 2025 (following a minor [v1.1 revision](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posi-v1.1-revisions.pdf) in November 2023). As an early POSI adopter and a member of the subsequently formed POSI adopters group, ROR was involved in shaping the revision alongside other community collaborators. The v2.0 revision does not alter the spirit or intent of the principles, but rather clarifies and expands on some key points and nuances that emerged through community consultations and also in response to ongoing changes in the scholarly infrastructure landscape. 

In the wake of the POSI v2.0 release, in recognition of the five years since our initial self-assessment, and as we mark the milestone of ROR’s seventh anniversary, we wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on ROR’s alignment with the POSI framework and re-assert our commitment to providing open scholarly infrastructure for the global community. 

## Evaluation process

The POSI framework focuses on three key areas of focus: **accountability (governance)**, **resourcing (sustainability)**, and **protection of community interests (insurance)**. Twenty principles within these areas of focus provide more specific guidelines and expectations. The principles are intended to provide guidance; they are not intended to function as a set of rules or a checklist, and it is not expected or required that all of the principles will be relevant for every organization or initiative. 

For our updated self-assessment, we reviewed the updated principles from version 1.1 and version 2.0 and evaluated ROR’s current and planned activities against these principles. 
Similar to the 2020 assessment, we evaluated degrees of alignment with the principles using a “traffic light” ranking, where green indicates strong alignment, yellow indicates partial alignment or alignment in process, and red indicates weak alignment or non-alignment. There is no standard POSI assessment metric; some organizations have adopted the traffic light framework while others have taken different approaches. 

As ROR is a jointly operated initiative and not a standalone organization, some of the principles are less applicable than others. If an item is marked as green, this doesn’t mean ROR does this perfectly or that our work in this area is done; it simply indicates that we feel confident about our level of alignment and continued ability to maintain this alignment.

## Governance principles

{{< figure src="/img/blog/posi-v2/posi-v2-governance-table.png" alt="POSI v2 ROR self-assessment of governance." >}}


***Coverage across the scholarly enterprise – research transcends disciplines, geography, institutions, and stakeholders. Organisations and the infrastructure they run need to reflect this.***

* ROR is a global registry - in terms of geography, organization type, metadata practices
* ROR infrastructure is openly available and is used all over the world without restrictions
* ROR community activities focus on global engagement, featuring diverse stakeholders and supporting multilingual interactions 

***Stakeholder governed – a board-governed organisation drawn from the stakeholder community builds confidence that the organisation will make decisions driven by community consensus and a balance of interests.***

* ROR is not a standalone organization and therefore has no official mechanism for board governance. ROR governance operations are carried out by three nonprofit organizations that are representative of ROR’s key stakeholder communities and specified in an official Memorandum of Agreement. 
* ROR also engages stakeholder input and guidance on strategic directions through its Steering Group, open community calls, curation advisory board, and public calls for feedback. 

***Non-discriminatory participation or membership – we see the best option to be an “opt-in” approach with principles of non-discrimination and inclusivity, where any relevant group may express an interest and should be welcome. Representation in governance must reflect the character of the community or membership.***

* ROR infrastructure can be accessed and used by anyone without a membership or a license or any other type of restriction. 
* ROR community activities are openly available for anyone to opt-in. 
* ROR’s inclusion criteria for registry records is based on adherence to ROR’s scope. Any organization can be included in the registry within that scope; there are no fees or licenses or other permissions required to add an organization to the registry or to maintain the metadata associated with the organization’s record. 

***Transparent governance – to foster trust, the processes and policies for governing the organisation and selecting representatives to governance groups should be transparent (within the constraints of privacy laws).***

* ROR is operated as a collaborative initiative by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite. The three ROR governing organizations collectively assume and share responsibility for ROR governance, operations, resourcing, and decision-making. These responsibilities are defined in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA is approved by the governance bodies of each governing organization.  
* Responsibility for ROR is designed and premised on the following core principles:
    * ROR is a collaborative, open infrastructure initiative and service. 
    * ROR is not an independent organization or legal entity. 
    * ROR is committed to following the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI).
    * ROR cannot be governed by, purchased by, controlled by or sold to a commercial entity.
    * The ROR governing organizations agree to not transfer control of any aspect of ROR or the ROR system to a commercial entity.
* The MOA is published on the ROR website
* Financials for the past X years are publicly shared on the ROR website
* Financial contributors are acknowledged on the ROR website
* We do not currently make detailed financial information publicly available, such as staff salaries, or the amounts that individual organizations contribute to ROR

***Cannot lobby – infrastructure organisations should not lobby for regulatory change to cement their own positions or narrow self-interest. However, an infrastructure organisation’s role is to support its community, and this can include advocating for policy changes.***

* ROR’s primary focus is to provide useful infrastructure for the community in the form of data and services that support a variety of use cases and needs. 
* ROR operates on a core set of values and principles, including but not limited to POSI, based on the premise that scholarly infrastructure should be open. 
* ROR’s position and values are not motivated by self-interest but by the belief that open infrastructure provides a collective benefit. 
* ROR team members and community stakeholders participate in activities and initiatives to advance this objective in the name of the common good. Some of these activities and initiatives may influence policy decisions, such as in the emergence of national persistent identifier policies in multiple countries that specifically mention ROR. 

***Living will – to build trust, organisations should establish and communicate clear commitments regarding their long-term stewardship responsibilities, including the principles by which assets, data, resources, services, and staff would be responsibly transferred to a successor or the organisation or service wound down. The commitments should address future governance, with defined criteria for acceptable successor organisations. This should include continued alignment with POSI and any legal or structural constraints.***

* ROR’s operating organizations have a Memorandum of Agreement (published on the ROR website) that describes how ROR would be shut down and how relevant responsibilities could be transferred to responsible successors, if applicable. The succession plan also accounts for assets such as code repositories, cash funds, and technical infrastructure.
* ROR data is openly available under a CC0 waiver by default, allowing access to persist beyond the life of the initiative. 
* ROR code is openly licensed on GitHub and can be forked by anyone.
* ROR data files are published on Zenodo and archived through Zenodo’s processes. 

***Regular review of purpose and community value – Organisations and services should regularly review their relevance, effectiveness, and the level of community support to determine whether their continued operation is necessary. If no longer needed, they should take responsible steps to transition or wind down operations in consultation with the community and in alignment with their living will.***

* ROR’s operating organization and core team members regularly assess ROR’s strategic objectives, level of adoption and usage, and ongoing progress in order to ensure that ROR’s offering is aligned with community needs. 
* In the event that ROR’s operating organizations identify evidence that ROR is no longer needed, they will take the necessary steps to wind down the initiative in accordance with the process outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement. 

{{< figure src="/img/blog/posi-v2/posi-v2-sustainability-table.png" alt="POSI v2 ROR self-assessment of sustainability." >}}

***Transparent operations - to enable organisational accountability and openness, the operating policies and procedures, detailed financials, sustainability models, fees, strategic and product roadmaps, organisational charts, and other appropriate operational information should be made openly available (within the constraints of privacy laws). Information should be available for investigation and reuse by the community.***

* Things that are open now
    * Memorandum of Agreement
    * Financials
    * Business model info
    * Roadmap
    * Curation process and curation data
    * Historical documents about how ROR came to be
* Things that we could make more open in the future
    * Internal operations, e.g., how we run community calls, incident response, other things that could be useful for other initiatives to learn from

***Time-limited funds are used only for time-limited activities – operations should be supported by sustainable revenue sources, whereas time-limited funds are used only for time-limited activities. Depending on grants to fund ongoing and/or long-term operations fully makes organisations fragile and distracts from maintaining core infrastructure.***

* Since XXXX, ROR’s core operations are not dependent on any time-limited funds
* Core expenses are funded by in-kind support from the operating organizations
* We receive additional contributions from community supporters but this is not the primary source of funding
* We do not charge for access and usage and do not intend to

***Goal to generate surplus – it is not enough to merely survive; organisations and services have to be able to adapt and change. Organisations and services that define long-term sustainability based only on recovering costs risk becoming brittle and stagnant. To weather economic, social and technological volatility, organisations and services need financial resources beyond immediate operating costs.***

* ROR’s core operating costs have stable funding from operating organizations, plus additional funds from ad hoc contributions
* Additional reserves from community contributions to carry forward 1-2 years
* We review budget throughout the year to anticipate any volatility

***Establish and maintain financial reserves guided by policy – organisations and services should have a clear policy on maintaining financial reserves, including the purpose, minimum and maximum level, and governance of these funds. The actual level of reserves should be determined and periodically reviewed by the governing body, ensuring that resources are available to support Living Will implementation, including an orderly wind-down, transition to a successor, or response to major unforeseen events. A financial reserve policy might include how funds will be held, under what circumstances they will be used, and how much would be necessary for an adequate wind-down or transfer of assets, given the complexity of the organisation’s infrastructure.***

* “Informal policy” of reserves agreed upon by the operating organization 
* Regularly reviewed by the operating organizations to anticipate any unforeseen expenses
* Principle of keeping ROR costs low and minimal 
* MOA specifies wind-down and transfer of assets

***Mission-consistent revenue generation – revenue sources should be evaluated against the infrastructure’s mission and not run counter to the aims of the organisation or service.***

* No revenue model and no current plans to offer paid services; objective is to make data offering freely available to everyone
* Currently receive ad hoc funds from contributor organizations that believe in our mission, but these are not directed donations, and there is no reward or “pay-to-play” agreement for these organizations
* In the future, we may pursue grant funding for time-limited projects in accordance with our mission 

***Revenue generated from services, not data – data related to the running of the scholarly infrastructure should be community property. Appropriate revenue sources might include value-added services, consulting, API Service Level Agreements, or membership fees.***

* No plans to offer paid services; objective is to make data offering freely available to everyone
* Data is CC0, code is MIT
* May consider some restrictions in the future such as API credentials, but not for a fee 

***Volunteer labour - organisations that rely on volunteers and their labour should recognise this as a valuable resource for the organisation’s long-term viability, and factor it into sustainability planning and risk management.***


* Have relied on volunteers to advise on curation. Identified when more dedicated resourcing was needed, and adjusted accordingly.
* We do not otherwise rely on volunteers for core operations.

***Transition planning - organisations that are heavily dependent on a limited number of individuals should take steps to reduce their dependence on these individuals, including via transition and succession planning, so that the organisation is not at risk of collapse in the event of their departure.***



* We have processes and logins documented and centralized to support continuity of institutional knowledge, and we have experienced staff transitions to test the quality of these safeguards, both in terms of staff members switching organizations and also leaving entirely. 
* Technical processes are documented and regularly reviewed with backup support
* MOU supports continued staffing of core personnel roles
* Comprehensive onboarding and offboarding checklists and training and documentation for new hires
* Goal is to make sure that we are not dependent on specific individuals. However, like any organization or initiative, especially a small community-focused one, any departure of key personnel will always have an impact.

***Open source – all software and non-physical assets required to run the infrastructure should be available under an open-source licence. This does not include other software that may be involved with running the organisation.***

* All of ROR’s code and software processes are openly stored and documented on GitHub. Code is published under a fully permissible MIT License. 
* We rely on additional tools and software to support our development work, such as hosting and logging. Wherever possible, we leverage open source components.
* We provide extensive documentation about how to access and query ROR data, and how to run the REST API locally, to enable other projects to use our data and code 

***Ensure open and secure data accessibility within legal and ethical constraints – To support potential forking or replication, infrastructure should aim to make all relevant data openly available, following best practices such as applying a CC0 waiver where appropriate. This must be balanced with compliance with privacy, data protection, and security requirements. Organisations should have a clear policy outlining how private or sensitive data will be handled—particularly in the event of a transfer to another organisation—to ensure continuity, legal compliance, and responsible stewardship.***

* The ROR dataset is made openly available under the terms of a CC0 waiver. 
* The ROR dataset can be accessed via a data file or by querying the ROR API
* ROR code is openly available and forkable under the terms of a MIT License. 
* No private or privileged information is included in the ROR dataset. We have a privacy policy published on our website that outlines how we handle private information, such as personal details of individuals on our community mailing list 

***Available and preserved – it is not enough that content, data, and software be “open” if there is no practical way to obtain them. These resources should be made easily available with clear public documentation about where they are and how to access them, as well as an open licence where possible. It is not enough that “open” resources are available. In line with the Living Will, it is essential to deposit content, data, and software with at least one trusted third-party digital archive.***

* ROR data is openly available under a CC0 waiver and can be accessed in multiple ways, all of which are publicly documented. The ROR data file is published on the Zenodo digital repository and is subject to Zenodo’s preservation practices, which include regular backup, replication, and fixity processes, a retention policy of at least 20 years, and succession planning in the event of repository closure
* ROR code is available on GitHub under the terms of a MIT License. 
* ROR code repositories are automatically archived in Software Heritage. The schedule is determined by Software Heritage. We may consider other automated or proactive mechanisms for code preservation moving forwards. 

***Patent non-assertion – the organisation should commit to a patent non-assertion policy or covenant. The organisation may obtain patents to protect its own operations, but not use them to prevent the community from replicating the infrastructure.***

* ROR is a fully open and public registry of factual information about research organizations. The metadata and curatorial stewardship that we apply to ROR registry data are not considered to be intellectual property of any ROR-related entity. Due to its factual nature, the information stored in the registry cannot be copyrighted or patented. In addition, ROR asserts no claims to registry data via the application of the CC0 1.0 public domain dedication. 

***Prioritise interoperability and open standards to ensure continuity and resilience - infrastructures should adopt and support widely accepted open standards—both formal and de facto—to ensure that systems, data, and services can be replicated, migrated, or integrated with minimal disruption without the use of proprietary extensions or software. Where relevant, organisations should document dependencies on standards.***

* ROR data can be accessed easily without proprietary extensions or software. For example, the ROR data file is available in both json and csv formats, and any integration can retrieve metadata via the REST API.
