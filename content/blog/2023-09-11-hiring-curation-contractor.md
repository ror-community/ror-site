ROR is seeking a short-term curation support contractor as registry curation activities continue to expand. Please consider submitting an application and help spread the word to your networks!

# About ROR and registry curation

The Research Organization Registry (ROR) is a community-led registry of open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifiers for every research organization in the world.

ROR is a [cross-organization collaborative led by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite](/about#governance-model). Each organization provides input on decisions and overall strategy that support the growth and sustainability of ROR by engaging in outreach to funders, potential adopters, and other stakeholders in their respective networks.

The ROR registry includes IDs and metadata for more than 105,000 research organizations and counting. ROR receives regular input from its global community of users and stakeholders about records that should be added to or updated in the registry. ROR also seeks and incorporates input from the broader community about policies and processes for maintaining registry data. We review and process this feedback through a centralized process and according to metadata policies established and maintained by ROR's [curation advisory board](/registry#curation-advisory-board) and [metadata curation lead](/about#core-team). All requests are publicly visible in an open [Github repository](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates#readme) so that the process is as transparent as possible. New registry [releases](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/releases) are published on a rolling basis, approximately once a month. 

Since [officially launching its new curation model](/blog/2022-03-17-first-independent-release) in early 2022, ROR's volume of curation activities has been increasing steadily. In order to keep up with this growth, we are looking to scale resourcing on the ROR team accordingly, beginning with hiring short-term contract support to help maintain the pipeline of requests. Contract support will better equip ROR to be as responsive as possible to requests, to work with community members interested in submitting unique types of requests such as bulk lists of organizations, and to pursue special strategic projects such as the [reconciliation of Crossref's Open Funder Registry with ROR](/blog/2023-09-07-open-funder-registry-transition-ror-cross-post). This short-term support will also allow us to assess bigger-picture and longer-term needs with regard to curation staffing.
