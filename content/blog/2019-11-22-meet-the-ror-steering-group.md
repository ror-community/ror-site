Approximately one year ago, a ROR project team formed as the outcome of the prior [OrgID initiative](https://ror.org/about/#history) to initiate a [startup effort to develop the first iteration of the ROR registry](https://ror.org/blog/2018-12-02-the-ror-of-the-crowd/). This team, a collaboration between California Digital Library, Crossref, DataCite, and Digital Science, [launched the registry](https://ror.org/blog/2019-02-10-announcing-first-ror-prototype/) in January 2019.

Expanding the ROR Steering Group beyond the four organizations that launched ROR is key to driving adoption of ROR IDs, reinforcing community engagement, and supporting long-term sustainability. The Steering Group will help to guide ROR's strategic directions and champion the use of open identifiers for research organizations across the scholarly communication landscape.
