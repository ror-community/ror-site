description = "In the June 2022 edition of the ROR Community Advisory Group meeting, we first welcome Amanda French, ROR's new Technical Community Manager. Next, we hear an in-depth explanation from eLife on how they include ROR in their preprint and publication metadata, as well as a brief update from Crossref on their progress on adding support to ROR. Lastly, we discuss our proposals for how to handle inactive organizations in ROR and ask for feedback by the middle of July."
