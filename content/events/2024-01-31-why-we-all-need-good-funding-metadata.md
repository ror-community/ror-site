description = "Funding information is an increasingly important piece of metadata for many stakeholders, yet standardizing and using identifiers for funders remains a challenge. With ROR set to become the standard persistent identifier for funders, we convene a panel for ROR’s annual community meeting to hear from diverse perspectives about how funding metadata is used and what might make it better. We hear from funders, publishers, metadata specialists, and more."
