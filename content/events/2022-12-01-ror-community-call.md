description = "In the ROR Community Advisory Group meeting for December 2022, the ROR team shares the dates for the ROR Annual Meeting and announces the ROR is a recipient of support from the Global Sustainability Coalition for Open Science Services (SCOSS). We have implemented our proposal for inactive organizations, and we have a final draft of our proposal on schema and API versioning. We welcome new Curation Advisory Board members Shayn Smulyan (Crossref) and Matthias Liffers (ARDC), and we learn about how Rockefeller University Press (RUP) and Silverchair use ROR."
