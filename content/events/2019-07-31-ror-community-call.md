description = "In this ROR Community Advisory Group meeting, we give updates on GRID synchronization, making ROR available as in a JSON data dump, and the forthcoming proposal on ROR in the Crossref metadata schema. We ask people to save the date of January 28, 2020 for PIDapalooza in Lisbon and remind people to sign and share the statement of support for ROR. ROR's three experimental working groups are set to start meeting in June: Outreach, Policy, and Implementation / Adoption."
