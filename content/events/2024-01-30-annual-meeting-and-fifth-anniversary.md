We hear about where we've been and where we're going in terms of our community of adopters, our curation activities, and our tech. Most importantly, we also acknowledge ROR community contributors, without whom we’d never have come this far, and we do some brainstorming about what's next. In conclusion: let’s ROR some more in 2024!"
