- Description: This ACRL Choice / LibTech Insights webinar includes speakers from both ROR and OpenAlex. Analyzing an institution’s research outputs helps research libraries align their collections strategies with community needs, estimate their previous and future spends on article processing charges (APCs), understand the impact of transformative agreements, and much more. Yet this analysis has remained difficult because researcher institution affiliation metadata is often captured in publications as unstandardized plain text, while both affiliation identifiers and databases that link publications to institutions have often been proprietary. In this webinar, we will go over recent innovations in open research metadata that are disrupting this model and explain what librarians can do both to get the data they need and to improve their own institution’s data in downstream research intelligence tools.
