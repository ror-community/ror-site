description = "NSF Facilities play many important roles in the research ecosystem and tracking their contributions is a difficult on-going task. Historically, facilities have relied on acknowledgements in scientific papers and other research outputs to identify usage. This webinar addresses the question of how NSF facilities can take advantage of these identifiers to help track impact."
