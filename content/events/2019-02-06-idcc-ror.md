description = "The ROR project addresses a gap in the scholarly community ecosystem: the lack of open, stakeholder-governed-infrastructure for research organization identifiers and associated metadata that can uniquely identify research outputs with the institutions where research is produced. In this talk, we'll introduce you to ROR and let you know how you can do more with ROR."
