description = "ROR (Research Organization Registry) is a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world. The scope of ROR is the affiliation use case—to unambiguously identify which organizations are affiliated with which research outputs. In this lightning talk, we highlight the crucial role of the ROR community by sharing details about the makeup and expertise of the ROR Community Advisory Group, the ways in which we work with community advisors to get input on the registry’s curation policies and technical implementation, and the role of the community in ROR’s future."
