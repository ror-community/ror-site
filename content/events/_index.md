### Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata

At the ROR annual meeting in January 2024, the session [Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata](2024-01-31-why-we-all-need-good-funding-metadata) addressed the issue that funding information is an increasingly important piece of metadata for many stakeholders, yet standardizing and using identifiers for funders remains a challenge. With ROR set to become the standard persistent identifier for funders, we convened a panel for ROR’s annual community meeting to hear from diverse perspectives about how funding metadata is used and what might make it better. We heard from funders, publishers, metadata specialists, and more, including CHORUS, the publishing unit of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Dryad, Crossref, and from Stratos for Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s, and afterward joined a discussion about funding metadata challenges and opportunities.

### ROR Community Showcase

### ROR Annual Community Meeting and Fifth Anniversary Celebration

The 2024 version of the ROR annual meeting was a special one! We held a [ROR Annual Community Meeting and Fifth Anniversary Celebration](2024-01-30-annual-meeting-and-fifth-anniversary) in January 2024 to celebrate ROR turning 5 years old, taking the opportunity to reflect on the last five years, remembering where we started and how we got here. We hear about where we've been and where we're going in terms of our community of adopters, our curation activities, and our tech. Most importantly, we also acknowledge ROR community contributors, without whom we’d never have come this far, and we do some brainstorming about what's next. In conclusion: let’s ROR some more in 2024!
