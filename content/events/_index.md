### Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata
- Date: Wednesday, January 31, 2024
- Time: [3pm UTC](https://dateful.com/convert/coordinated-universal-time-utc?t=3pm&d=2024-01-31)
- Duration: 1 hour
- Location: Online
- Recorded: Yes
- Description:  Funding information is an increasingly important piece of metadata for many stakeholders, yet standardizing and using identifiers for funders remains a challenge. With ROR set to become the standard persistent identifier for funders, we are convening a panel for ROR’s annual community meeting to hear from diverse perspectives about how funding metadata is used and what might make it better. We'll hear from funders, publishers, metadata specialists, and more, including
	- **Howard Ratner, Executive Director, [CHORUS](https://chorus.org)**
	- **Caroline Burley, Journals Manager, Publishing Services & Production, [Royal Society of Chemistry](https://www.rsc.org/)**
	- **Sarah Lippincott, Head of Community Engagment, [Dryad](https://datadryad.org)**
	- **Patricia Feeney, Head of Metadata, [Crossref](https://crossref.org)**
	- **Kristen Ratan / Sonya Dumanis, [Aligning Science Against Parkinson's](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/#)**
	- **Michael Lam, Chief Data Officer, [Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp)** 

Additional panelists may be announced closer to the time. After brief 5-minute presentations from each panelists, the audience will be invited to join in a 20-minute discussion about funding metadata challenges and opportunities.
