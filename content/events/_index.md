### Advancing Open Science: The Barcelona Declaration and Open Metadata
At the [Advancing Open Science event held in Vilnius](2024-12-06-advancing-open-science-vilnius), participants discuss the most important developments in open science and research information in Europe and Lithuania. The keynote speaker, Prof. Ludo Waltman (Leiden University, The Netherlands), presents the Barcelona Declaration, a document highlighting the importance of open access to research information. Recent Lithuanian open access policy priorities and their impact on the national research ecosystem are presented, and representatives from the university alliances Arqus, Transform4Europe and ERUA share their experiences and practical solutions in promoting open science. Discussions also explore how to make the process of sharing scientific information more efficient, including tools such as the Research Organization Registry (ROR).

### ROR Community Call November 2024 
In the [ROR Community Call for November 2024](2024-11-20-ror-community-call), we hear updates from the ROR team on domains and link checking in ROR, projects to increase regional coverage of Japanese and Portuguese organizations, implementation of schema v2.1, deprecation of schema and API v1, and the deployment of client identification on the ROR API. We also see demos of two featured ROR integrations: the MESR / OpenAlex Works Magnet that enables the community to submit organization corrections to OpenAlex, and the Global Change Information System (GCIS) of the USGCRP.

### Open Affiliation Metadata: How Recent Innovations Help Libraries and Librarians
The ACRL Choice / LibTech Insights webinar [Open Affiliation Metadata: How Recent Innovations Help Libraries and Librarians](2024-11-07-open-affiliation-metadata) includes speakers from both ROR and OpenAlex. Analyzing an institution’s research outputs helps research libraries align their collections strategies with community needs, estimate their previous and future spends on article processing charges (APCs), understand the impact of transformative agreements, and much more. Yet this analysis has remained difficult because researcher institution affiliation metadata is often captured in publications as unstandardized plain text, while both affiliation identifiers and databases that link publications to institutions have often been proprietary. In this webinar, we will go over recent innovations in open research metadata that are disrupting this model and explain what librarians can do both to get the data they need and to improve their own institution’s data in downstream research intelligence tools.

### New Features for Organization Information in DSpace with ROR
In [New Features for Organization Information in DSpace with ROR](2024-10-03-ror-in-dspace), a webinar co-hosted with [4Science](https://4science.com), we hear about how and why 4Science incorporated ROR, the Research Organization Registry, into both DSpace-CRIS and DSpace 8 in order to improve the quality of organization metadata in both systems.

### Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata

At the ROR annual meeting in January 2024, the session [Why We All Need Good Funding Metadata](2024-01-31-why-we-all-need-good-funding-metadata) addressed the issue that funding information is an increasingly important piece of metadata for many stakeholders, yet standardizing and using identifiers for funders remains a challenge. With ROR set to become the standard persistent identifier for funders, we convened a panel for ROR’s annual community meeting to hear from diverse perspectives about how funding metadata is used and what might make it better. We heard from funders, publishers, metadata specialists, and more, including CHORUS, the publishing unit of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Dryad, Crossref, and from Stratos for Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s, and afterward joined a discussion about funding metadata challenges and opportunities.

### ROR Community Showcase

At the ROR annual meeting in January 2024, the [Community Showcase](2024-01-30-community-showcase) featured presentations on how ROR is used in some key global scholarly systems and workflows, including at OpenAlex, 4Science / DSpace-CRIS, ORCID, Springer Nature, US Department of Energy's Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), and the ROR Implementation Task Group of the NIH’s Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI).

### ROR Annual Community Meeting and Fifth Anniversary Celebration

The 2024 version of the ROR annual meeting was a special one! We held a [ROR Annual Community Meeting and Fifth Anniversary Celebration](2024-01-30-annual-meeting-and-fifth-anniversary) in January 2024 to celebrate ROR turning 5 years old, taking the opportunity to reflect on the last five years, remembering where we started and how we got here. We hear about where we've been and where we're going in terms of our community of adopters, our curation activities, and our tech. Most importantly, we also acknowledge ROR community contributors, without whom we’d never have come this far, and we do some brainstorming about what's next. In conclusion: let’s ROR some more in 2024!
