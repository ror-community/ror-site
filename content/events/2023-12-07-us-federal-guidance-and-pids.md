In this call, we hear updates about ROR Curation, Tech, and Adoption, including stats on the number of recent curation requests (a lot!), the beta release of version 2 of the ROR schema and API, and new and notable ROR adoptions, plus interesting stats on ROR and affiliations in ORCID. We also hear from three featured integrators: Tom Morrell of Caltech on his university's ROR-enabled repositories, Nick Veenstra of University of Groningen on mapping messy organization data from the CRIS system to ROR, and Nina Tscheke of ScienceOpen on their platform's use of ROR.
