description = "ROR is the Research Organization Registry, a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world. We are building open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata, and we've just released a working prototype that's ready for people to use. Join us for a fun and interactive session exploring the challenges with organizational identifiers and how ROR is addressing them."
