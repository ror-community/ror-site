description = "Institutions need accurate lists of their publications for critical research intelligence use cases. These lists are built from affiliation data, and automated matching makes mistakes. This webinar demonstrates how curating ROR records and validating OpenAlex’s affiliation-to-ROR matches leads to more complete and trustworthy institutional research records. Speakers include Kyle Demes (COO, OpenAlex) and Amanda French (ROR Technical Community Manager)."
