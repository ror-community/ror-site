ROR is a collaborative effort driven by multiple organizations and individuals. The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. Wide adoption and support across the scholarly research community is central to ROR's growth, sustainability, and success. The support is balanced across the ROR Community Advisory Group, Signatories, and financial Supporters. Also take a look at the [steering organizations and project teams](/about) who are driving ROR forward.

## ROR Supporters

All of ROR’s work so far has been completed through in-kind donations from ROR steering organizations. We are committed to ROR for the long-term but we can’t move forward without dedicated community support. We are running a fundraising campaign in order to be able to scale up our operations, hire dedicated staff, and develop and deliver new features, with a plan to launch a paid service tier in 2022 to recover costs while keeping the registry's data open and free.

**ROR aims to raise $175,000 in donations over the next two years.** As a supporter, you’ll have an opportunity to be part of this exciting community effort from the beginning and to ensure its long-term growth and success.

**Our first fundraising target is $75,000 by the end of 2019** in order to secure enough funds to hire a technical lead and to organize an in-person ROR Community planning meeting at PIDapalooza in January 2020.

### Calling all panthera!

**What kind of animal are you?**
There are four types of big cats in the world that have the ability to ROAR. Our suggested donation amounts are named for these four cats. We welcome and appreciate donations of all shapes and sizes, however!
