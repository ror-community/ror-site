## Community values

ROR is community-supported, community-driven, community-funded open infrastructure.

The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. With adoption and involvement across the scholarly research community, we ensure the long-term sustainability of open infrastructure for research organization identifiers.

ROR is governed, operated, and financially supported by [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org), [Crossref](https://crossref.org), and [DataCite](https://datacite.org) -- three trusted organizations that each have deep expertise in developing open, sustainable, community-driven infrastructure for scholarly communications. ROR’s three governing organizations share [collective responsibility](/about#governance-model) for operating ROR and commit in-kind support to cover ROR’s core personnel and operating expenses.

The wider ROR community includes users and stakeholders from around the world and across many types of institutions and industries, including:
- Libraries
- Research offices
- publishers
- Data repositories
- Platform providers
- CRIS systems
- Government agencies
- Funders

Community involvement in ROR takes many forms:

- [Community advisors](#community-advisors) help shape ROR’s priorities and future directions through the Steering Group and Community Advisory Group
- [Adopters](#adopters) integrate ROR in their systems and champion best practices with ROR IDs
- [Supporters](#supporters) contribute financially to the sustainability of ROR’s open infrastructure

## Community advisors

### Steering Group

The ROR Steering Group is an advisory body composed of the [ROR Operations Team](/about#operations-team) plus external members. The ROR Steering Group was [initiated in November 2019](/blog/2019-11-22-meet-the-ror-steering-group/) and provides input on ROR priorities and strategy. Steering Group activities are guided by a [terms of reference document](/documents/ROR-Steering-Group-Terms-2022-06.pdf).
