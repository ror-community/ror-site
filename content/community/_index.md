## Community values
ROR is community-supported, community-driven, community-funded open infrastructure.

The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. With adoption and involvement across the scholarly research community, we ensure the long-term sustainability of open infrastructure for research organization identifiers.

ROR is governed, operated, and financially supported by [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org), [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org), and [DataCite](https://datacite.org) -- three trusted organizations that each have deep expertise in developing open, sustainable, community-driven infrastructure for scholarly communications. ROR’s three governing organizations share [collective responsibility](/about#governance) for operating ROR and commit in-kind support to cover ROR’s core personnel and operating expenses.

The wider ROR community includes users and stakeholders from around the world and across many types of institutions and industries, including **publishers, libraries, platform providers, university research offices, data repositories, CRIS systems, government agencies, funders, and more.** 

## Community groups 

### Community Forum
The [ROR Community Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-community) is the primary way to get involved in ROR. Join the ROR Community Forum to receive announcements and event invitations from ROR, engage with other ROR users, and give feedback on ROR's current projects and future direction. 

### Technical Forum 
The [ROR Technical Forum](https://groups.google.com/a/ror.org/g/ror-tech) is for developers who would like to receive announcements of new data releases and technical changes to ROR and would like to discuss technical topics with other developers using ROR. 
 
### Curation Advisory Board 
The [ROR Curation Advisory Board](/registry/#curation-advisory-board) reviews suggested updates to the registry and advises on curation practices and standards. 

### Steering Group
The ROR Steering Group is a small advisory body composed of the [ROR Operations Team](/about/team/#operations-team) plus external members who are key stakeholders in the global scholarly communication ecosystem. The ROR Steering Group was [initiated in November 2019](/blog/2019-11-22-meet-the-ror-steering-group/) to provide input on ROR priorities and strategy. Steering Group activities are guided by a [terms of reference document](/documents/ROR-Steering-Group-Terms-2023-01.pdf).
