## Community values
ROR is community-supported, community-driven, community-funded open infrastructure.

The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. With adoption and involvement across the scholarly research community, we ensure the long-term sustainability of open infrastructure for research organization identifiers.

ROR stakeholders and community members include users and stakeholders from around the world and across many types of institutions and industries, including **publishers, libraries, platform providers, university research offices, data repositories, CRIS systems, government agencies, funders, and more.** 

## Community groups

### Steering Group

The ROR Steering Group is a small advisory body composed of the [ROR Operations Team](/about#operations-team) plus external members who are key stakeholders in the global scholarly communication ecosystem. The ROR Steering Group was [initiated in November 2019](/blog/2019-11-22-meet-the-ror-steering-group/) to provide input on ROR priorities and strategy. Steering Group activities are guided by a [terms of reference document](/documents/ROR-Steering-Group-Terms-2023-01.pdf).
